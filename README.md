This is a preliminary prototype for working with [IEDB](http://iedb.org)-style data in a git repository. Requirements are GNU Make, Python 3 (see `requirements.txt`), and Java 8.

The data is in a separate repository: https://github.com/jamesaoverton/covic-db-data-prototype

A demo is here: https://cvdb.ontodev.com
